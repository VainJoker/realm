## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
toml
[dependencies]
realme = "0.1.0"
```


## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use Realme:

```rust
use realme::{TomlParser, StringSource, Adaptor,Realme};

fn main() {
    const CONFIGURATION1: &str = r#"key1 = "value""#;

    let realme = Realme::builder()
    .load(
        Adaptor::new(
            Box::new(
                StringSource::<TomlParser>::new(
                    CONFIGURATION1
            )))
        )
    .build()
    .expect("Building configuration object");

    let value :String = realme
        .get("key1")
        .expect("Accessing configuration object")
        .try_into().unwrap();

    println!("'key1' Config element is: '{value:?}'");
}
```
